# Polkadot Sign In

### Current Practice

In a Web2 world, OAuth is the industry-standard protocol for authorization, it obtains an access token--a string denoting a specific scope, lifetime, and other access attributes. Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the approval of the resource owner. Then the client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

In Web3, injected signers are widely used for connecting accounts with dApps, for example, Metamask one-click connect gives the dApp Ethereum accounts information with `eth_account` method, WalletConnect generate a QR code to connect a mobile wallet with its handshake protocol. And after connecting, every user action needs to be signed by the injected Ethereum account, this method is safe and efficient.

Considering injected signers' "connect" feature as a sign-in method is not optimal because a malicious user could inject a custom signer like Metamask with a customized `eth_account` method so that the malicious user could pretend to be the owner of a labeled Ethereum address. So that for an injected signer, the user needs to sign a piece of data for each action, which is not efficient and has a bad user experience.

A combination with OAuth and injected signer should be raised, there is some research and practices as listed below:

[EAuth](https://github.com/pelith/node-eauth-server)
[Sign in with Magic links](https://magic.link/docs/blockchains/ethereum) rely on JsonRpcProvider
[DAuth](https://github.com/madhavanmalolan/dauth) registration by decentralized authorities.
[ethereum oauth](https://github.com/Recoblix/ethereum-oauth)
This paper [OAuth 2.0 authorization using blockchain-based tokens]
auth0 team has make a [proposal](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-ethereum-and-smart-contracts-part-3/)

to ask the user to sign such a magic string with injected signers and provides it as an access tokens for Applications. But instead of verified by authorization server who holds the approval of resource owner (user), it should be verified in a decentralized way.

### Specification

#### Sign in Participants

- **Service providers** are the dApps that have the sign-in requirement.
- **Identity providers** are the injected signers which provide the authentication information of the user who holds the wallet.
- **Resource Owners** are the users who hold the crypto wallets, have registered identities on ENS.

#### Workflow

The workflow works the same with or without OAuth specification. Only the 4th step will differ.

1. A user sends a request to a service provider.
2. The service provider sends a callback address, the sign-in challenge, and required permissions to the user.
3. The user connects to the injected signer.
4. injected signed to sign the challenge, and send the signature together with the public address, an access token specifying the scopes like valid time, back to the callback address. With OAuth Implementation, the access token is compliant with the OAuth standard.
5. The service provider validates the signature, if successful, the user signed in,
6. If there is no related user information in the database, the service provider will lookup for the user information from Identity Registrar, if related TEXT records are found for this address, the information will be imported into the service providerâ€™s database.

### Implementation

1.  Sign-in Request

    User want to sign in the dApp by send a simple request with identity chain type, eg: ETH, Litentry, Polks, etc.

    The payload is required since each chain has its own algorithmic mechanism.

    **request payload(1)**

    ```
    {
        "identity-type": "eth"
    }
    ```

2.  Authentication Requirement

    dApp will return the callback info.
    The callback endpoint is used by Identity provider to send signature data to dApp.

    ```
    {
        "identity-type": "eth",
        "callback-endpoint": "http://dapp.com/login/callback",
    }
    ```

3.  Connect to Signer

    User sends request to the Identity Provider (Injected Signer like : Polkadot.js Extension, Metamask, Parity Signer ...).

    This action will call up a browser extension or some other external applications.

    ```
    {
        "identity-type": "eth",
        "callback-endpoint": "http://dapp.com/login/callback",
    }
    ```

4.  Provide Signature
    The Identity Provider will generate the Signature data.

    ```
    {
        "identity-type": "eth",
        "public-key": "xxxxxxxx",
        "account-signed": "xxxxxxxxxx",
        "scope": ["xxx", "yyy"],
    }
    ```

    explains:

    - identity-type

      This field is used to choose the chain type and account.

    - public-key

      With the chain account chosen, get the public key of the account. This field will be used by dApp to decrypt the data and verify data consistency.

    - account-signed

      use private key to sign the account.

      eg:

      ```
      account = 0x1016f75c54c607f082ae6b0881fac0abeda21781

      private-key = 18e14a7b6a307f426a94f8114701e7c8e774e7f9a47e2c2035db29a206321725
      ```

      ```
      account-signed = ECIES ( ${account} , ${private-key})

      # encrypt account with private-key by the specified algorithmic mechanism: ECIES

      ```
  
    - scope
    
        scope define the permission needed for the dapp to interact with the account.

    
    The Identity Provider will send the signature data to the callback endpoint of dApp by step #3.

5.  Validation

    The dApp receives the signature data and do the verification.

        ```
        {
            "identity-type": "eth",
            "public-key": "xxxxxxxx",
            "account-signed": "xxxxxxxxxx",
            "scope": ["xxx", "yyy"],
        }
        ```

    Verification Steps:
    - use **public-key** to decrypt the data of **account-signed** , this progress should be successful, and get the account address.

        **public-key** pairs with **private-key**, this step proves the validity of the private key, and ensure that the data was not tampered with.
     

    - use **public-key** to generate the address by the specified algorithmic mechanism according to the chain type, and get the account address refer to **public-key** .        

    - verify the two account address , success if they are the same. 

    - if failure, it means the public key does not match the account address, it may happen when some malicious users want to impersonate an account.

    - if success, the dApp should return the response to the Identity Provider with the payload:
        ```
        {
            "verified": true,
            "access-token": "xxxxxx"  # generated by dApp as access token
        }
        ```

6.  Lookup Identity

    The dApp gets the account address . It can retrieve the related information of account from the external service providers , such as ENS, Polkadot/Kusama Identity Registrar, etc.
